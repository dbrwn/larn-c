#Caverns of Larn

Originally written in the mid-1980s by Noah Morgan, Larn is a roguelike game
that runs in a terminal window.  

##Status

These sources are based on the v12.0 files included in the NetBSD distribution
[mirrored here](https://github.com/jsonn/src). I've made very limited changes
to make this compile and run on OS X in a terminal window.

Pull requests are welcome to add support for other platforms.

##License

See LICENSE.md. There are multiple copyright notices in the source (which are
all still there). There is no original license declaration by the original
author, Noah Morgan, who has passed away.  The original sources this work is
derived from is included in the NetBSD distribution and so a BSD-style 3-clause
license is used.

See README.ORIG for the original readme notice.
